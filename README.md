### Hi, I'm Joe Bonneau (yes, it rhymes!) 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently helping build out [Threshold Health](https://www.threshold.health/)
- ❤️‍🔥 I'm passionate about workflow efficiency and creating amazing user experiences
- 🌱 I’m currently in the process of learning Go
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a music fanatic and specifically love hip-hop and R&B 

I've always been a huge computer nerd, but somehow it took me until I was forced to work from home during COVID to try learning how to program. As it turns out, something that I tried on a whim turned out to be my true passion and I have been consistently excited about software engineering on and off the clock. My first personal project was [spoticli](https://github.com/joebonneau/spoticli), a CLI that filled a tooling gap that I had at the time. As a music fanatic, I was constantly creating playlists of new music for both my own enjoyment and to share with my friends. I had a defined workflow where I would create a monthly catch-all playlist and a few vibe-oriented playlists, and often I wanted to add tracks to multiple playlists at once. This ended up evolving into many other features that I brainstormed, and I had a lot of fun creating it.
