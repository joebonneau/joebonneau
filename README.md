### Hi, I'm Joe Bonneau (yes, it rhymes!) 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently helping build out [Threshold Health](https://www.threshold.health/)
- ❤️‍🔥 I'm passionate about workflow efficiency and creating amazing user experiences
- 🌱 I’m currently in the process of learning Go
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm a music fanatic and specifically love hip-hop and R&B 

I've always been a huge computer nerd, but somehow it took me until I was forced to work from home during COVID to try learning how to program. As it turns out, something that I tried on a whim turned out to be my true passion and I have been consistently excited about software engineering on and off the clock. My first personal project was [spoticli](https://github.com/joebonneau/spoticli), a CLI that filled a tooling gap that I had at the time. As a music fanatic, I was constantly creating playlists of new music for both my own enjoyment and to share with my friends. I had a defined workflow where I would create a monthly catch-all playlist and a few vibe-oriented playlists, and often I wanted to add tracks to multiple playlists at once. This ended up evolving into many other features that I brainstormed, and I had a lot of fun creating it.

I quite enjoy programming in Python due to the syntax and low barrier to entry, though I often find myself longing for a strong type system. This is why I ended up learning Go, and I really enjoy using it.  So far, I have used it at work to re-write a CLI using Go's amazing concurrency implementations and personally to help contribute to [sesh](https://github.com/joshmedeski/sesh), a workflow management tool for terminal multiplexers. I would definitely be interested in using it professionally moving forward. For similar reasons, it is also why I have been using TypeScript more in the past year or so. If you have any open roles, preferably in a smaller, tight-knit team, please feel free to get in touch with me!
